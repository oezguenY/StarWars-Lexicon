# StarWars-Lexicon

StarWars-Lexicon is an MVP practice project. Users can press on a button which triggers a web request. This web request gets a random StarWars character in JSON.

Framework:
* UIKit

Language: 
* Swift

Architecture:
* Model-View-Controller

Third-Party Libraries:
* Alamofire
* SwiftyJSON

Things I learned:
* Use different methods for web requests: Alamofire with Codable, Alamofire with SwiftyJSON, just Alamofire, and traditional URLSession
